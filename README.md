- Generate and execute terminal commands based on user prompts
- Works on both PowerShell and Unix-like shells (Automatically detected)

## Installation

- Download the binary from the [Releases](https://github.com/dh1011/llm-term/releases) page

- Set PATH to the binary

  - MacOS/Linux:

  ```
  export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/llm-term"
  ```

  - To set it permanently, add `export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/llm-term"` to your shell configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`)

  - Windows:

  ```
  set PATH="%PATH%;C:\path\to\llm-term"
  ```

  - To set it permanently, add `set PATH="%PATH%;C:\path\to\llm-term"` to your shell configuration file (e.g., `$PROFILE`)

## Development

1. Clone the repository
2. Build the project using Cargo: `cargo build --release`
3. The executable will be available in the `target/release` directory

## Usage

1. Set your OpenAI API key (if using OpenAI models):

   - MacOS/Linux:

     ```
     export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
     ```

   - Windows:
     ```
     set OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
     ```

2. If using Ollama, make sure it's running locally on the default port (11434)

3. Run the application with a prompt:

   ```
   ./llm-term "your prompt here"
   ```

4. The app will generate a command based on your prompt and ask for confirmation before execution.

## Configuration

A `config.json` file will be created in the same directory as the binary on first run. You can modify this file to change the default model and token limit.

## Options

- `-c, --config <FILE>`: Specify a custom config file path

## Supported Models

- OpenAI GPT-4 (gpt-4o)
- OpenAI GPT-4 Mini (gpt-4o-mini)
- Ollama (local models, default: qwen2.5-coder)
